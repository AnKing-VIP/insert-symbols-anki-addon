or later (same as Anki).

Behavior:

Mimics LibreOffice, but 1) doesn't match across nodes, 2) long presses with 
colon-delimited characters, and 3) arrows immediate replace not replace first

Colon-delimited / arrows: immediate replacement

Regular: replace on whitespace. Only fire if the previous char was whitespace
too.

It is possible to have keys that mask other keys (if it contains spaces),
but user can deal with it.
